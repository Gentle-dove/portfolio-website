            Alozie Royal Chiagozie is a passionate and detail-oriented web developer from Nigeria,
             specializing in front-end development and advancing toward full-stack expertise. With a strong command of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React,
              I focus on building responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly web applications that deliver seamless digital experiences.<br></br>

I am a graduate of the Frontend Engineering program at ALT School Africa, where I developed a deep understanding of modern frontend technologies, clean 
coding standards, and user-centered design principles. I leverage tools like VS Code for efficient development, Git and GitHub for version control, and 
continuously enhance my problem-solving skills through real-world projects and coding challenges.<br></br>

Beyond coding, I am driven by a desire to use technology as a tool for solving real-world problems and
 improving everyday life. Through my brand, GentleDev, I aim to create, teach, and collaborate on impactful software solutions that inspire growth and innovation.<br></br>

Let&apos;s connect â€” whether you&apos;re interested in collaborating, exchanging ideas, or exploring new 
opportunities in tech, I&apos;m always open to meaningful professional conversations.
